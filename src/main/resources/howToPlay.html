<h3>How to play</h3>
<p>
    The user controls the player square using the arrow keys.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="background-color: red; padding: 2px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> The red square is the <b>player</b>.</li>
    <li><span style="background-color: #8b4513; padding: 2px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Brown squares are <b>boxes</b>.</li>
    <li><span style="background-color: blue; padding: 2px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Blue squares are <b>stones</b>.</li>
    <li><span style="background-color: #fc0; padding: 2px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Yellow squares are <b>keys</b> <i>or</i> <b>locks</b> -- we fix this in the book.</li>
    <li><span style="background-color: #ccffcc; padding: 2px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Greenish squares are called <b>flux</b>.</li>
    <li><span style="background-color: gray; padding: 2px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> Gray squares are <b>walls</b>.</li>
    <li><span style="background-color: white; padding: 2px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> White squares are <b>air</b> (empty).</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If a box or stone is not supported by anything, it falls. The player can push one stone or box at a time, provided it is not obstructed or falling. The path between the box and the lower-right corner is initially obstructed by a lock, so the player has to get a key to remove it. Flux can be "eaten" (removed) by the player by stepping on it.
